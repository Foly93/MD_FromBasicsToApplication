# MD Tutorial: From Basics to Application

This directory contains the tutorial/training hybrid article "Molecular Dynamics: From Basics to Application" (for authors, see the list below). This document is designed to teach third-year science undergraduates the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and enable them to tackle their computational biophysics projects. Furthermore, this repository allows any user to contact the authors, report bugs, and participate in improving this article.

## The vision

MD simulations are a versatile computational tool that helps us better understand the physics behind biochemical processes. The versatility of this method comes at the cost of increased complexity, hindering beginners from taking up this skill. Although universities offer courses, not all researchers use them, and they might develop an interest in their scientific careers later on. Furthermore, university courses may benefit from this hybrid article's ideas and design choices. The vision further entails community-driven improvement of the course material to create a well-rounded, didactically valuable MD course that teaches molecular dynamics simulations in a nearly optimal way. Although the tutorial/training hybrid article is fully self-contained, i.e., anybody with a working Linux computer should be able to complete it, communicating problems/bottlenecks to the authors and asking for help is highly encouraged so that the user experience can be optimized over time. The fast-paced progress also means larger-scale updates will be required to replace outdated algorithms and methods. 

## Get involved

Help is always welcome, no matter the format. Any criticism, remarks, and participation are highly appreciated, and the most basic help is to work through the tutorials and ask questions that boggle your mind along the way.
