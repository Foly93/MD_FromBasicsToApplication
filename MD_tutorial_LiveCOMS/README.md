# MD Tutorial: From Basics to Application

This directory contains the tutorial/training hybrid article called "Molecular Dynamics: From Basics to Application" (for authors see the list below). This document is designed to teach third year science undergraduates the basics about molecular dynamics simulations and enable them to tackle their own computational biophysics projects. Furthermore, this repository enables any user to contact the authors, report bugs, and participate in the improvement of this article.

## The vision

MD simulations are a versatile computational tool to better understand the physics behind biochemical processes. The versatility of this method comes at the cost of increased complexity hindering beginners to take up this skill. And although courses are offeret by universities, not all researchers use them and might develop an interest later on in their scientific careers. Furhtermore, this course material can even be used by university leacturers as is or as inspiration. The vision furhter entails, community driven improvement of the course material to create a well-rounded, didactictally valuable MD course that teach molecular dynamics simulations in a near optimal way. Although the tutorial/training hybrid article is fully self contained, i.e. anybody with a working linux computer should be able to complete it, communicating problems/bottlenecks to the authors and asking for help is highly encouraged so that the user experience can be optimised over time. The fast paced progress also means larger scale updates will be required to replace outdated algorithms and methods. 

## Get involved

Help is always welcome, no matter the format. Any criticsm, remarks and participation is highly appreciated and the most basic help is simply to work through the tutorials ask questions boggling your mind along the way.

### Submit an issue

If you have a specific suggestion or request relating to the material on GitHub or our paper, please submit a request on our issue tracker.

### Submit a pull request

In case you are a lecturer and want to slightly alter the exercises/tasks to perfectly fit the course concept, it is encouraged to actually propose changes via a "pull request", even to the article itself. This will allow us to track your contributions, as well. In case of substantial contribution, the author list on this article can be appended to subsequent versions of this work, as they would be for a software project. New versions of this work are assigned unique, cite-able DOIs and essentially constitute preprints, so they can be cited as interim research products.
